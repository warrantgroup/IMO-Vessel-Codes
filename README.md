# Description 
The International Maritime Organization (IMO) number is a unique reference for ships and for registered ship owners and management companies. IMO numbers were introduced under the SOLAS Convention to improve maritime safety and security and to reduce maritime fraud. For ships, the IMO number remains linked to the hull for its lifetime, regardless of a change in name, flag, or owner.
